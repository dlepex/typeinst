# __Typeinst__
Typeinst is a tool to automate the creation of concrete types ("type instances") from generic/"template" types.

Typeinst uses the special fake struct declaration (DSL-struct, for brevity)  as the description of what types should be generated:
```go
import (
	"some-fictional-generic-package1/redblack"
	"some-fictional-generic-package2/std"
)
//go:generate typeinst
type _typeinst struct {
	IntTreeSet	func(K int, V struct{}) redblack.TreeMap
	FloatTreeMap	func(K float64, V float64) redblack.TreeMap
	StrSet		func(E string)  std.Set
} 
```
Each field of DSL-struct defines the single concrete type.

For each field *DSL-func* describes the substitution of type variables and the result of DSL-func is the generic type where this substitution takes place. The substitution is done by name.

## __Usage__

Typeinst is to be used with `go generate`, it has no command line options: it uses DSL-struct as its sole "option".

1. Install the tool first: `go install github.com/dlepex/typeinst`
1. Declare DSL-struct in some file of your package, together with go-generate comment, as in the example above.
	* The DSL-struct name must start with `_typeinst` prefix, it is strongly recommended to have one DSL-struct per package, and to declare it in a separate file.
1. Run `go generate` on your package.
1. The result is `<file>_ti.go`, where `<file>` is a name of the file where DSL-struct is declared. The file is generated in the same package and it contains ALL concrete types described by DSL-struct.

## __Features__
- __Selective type instantiation__: Typeinst will only create the required *generic types*, not the whole generic package at once. 
- [Constructor functions](#constructor-function) support
- [Type merging](#type-merging) support
- The implementer of a generic package doesn't need to use any special comments or magic imports. Generic package is a rather normal package, where some types (or type aliases) serve as type variables.

## __Terminology__

#### Type variable

Type variables (type-parameters of generic types) are declared within generic package, usually as empty interface:
```go
type A = interface{} // Alias is the preferred form.
type B interface{} // This form is possible too but it may be less convenient than the alias-based if you want to use a generic package directly i.e. w/o typeinst.

type C interface { // Non-empty interface type variables can be used as well.
	Less(C) bool     // Type variable C can only be substituted by types having `Less()` method.
}
```

__The names of DSL-func parameters define what types will serve as type variables__

As an implementor of a generic package you may __optionally__ use the special "typevar"-comment:
```go
type E = interface{} //typeinst: typevar
```
This comment only provides better error messages, in case a user of your generic package omits a type variable in DSL-func. 

Please note that, if the "typevar"-comment was used for one type variable, it MUST be used for the rest of them (in the same generic package).

#### Generic type

Type is considered generic if one or more type variables are [reachable](#reachability) from it.

Generic type `G` consists of:
- type declaration 
- methods (functions with receiver `G` or `*G`)
- *constructor functions*


*Root generic types* are the types that are explicitly instantiated (i.e. the results of DSL-funcs)

*Non-root generic types* are [reachable](#reachability) from root types, they are implicitly instantiated (and implicitly named). For instance, hypothetical root type `AVLTree` requires non-root type `AVLTreeNode`.

If you do not like the implicit ("mangled") names of non-root types, you can always name them on your own by making them root, i.e. by adding their explicit instantiation to DSL-struct.

#### Constructor function

Constructor function of generic type `G` is function that returns:
- `G`, `*G`, `[]G`, `[n]G`
- or their combination (e.g. `**G`, `*[42]G`,`[][][]*G`), max nesting depth is 16.
- in case of multiple return values: only the first return var is checked.


Constructor functions usually have names started with `New`, but this is not enforced.

#### Reachability

Type B is directly reachable from type A if it occurs in:
- type A declaration
- signatures of type A methods or constructor functions (bodies are not scanned)

Reachability is a transitive, non-symmetric relation.

#### Generic package

*Generic package* contains *generic types* and their *type variables*. 

__Generic packages cannot contain non-generic code__, move it to separate non-generic package if needed.

Non-generic code includes:
- functions (w/o receiver), excluding constructors of generic types 
- non-generic types and their methods
- var and const declarations

Generic package may import other packages. However, imported packages are never treated as generic themselves.

#### Type merging

Type merging allows an instantiated type to be assembled from multiple orthogonal behavioral parts.

"Behavioral parts" must have the same type after substitution of type variables.

```go
type T = interface{} 
type SliceF T[] // this type has filtering methods
func (a SliceF) Filter(...) ... {...}

type SliceA T[] // and this - aggregation methods: it may be declared in another generic package, with another (differently named) type variable.
func (a SliceA) Reduce(...) ... {...}
```

The merged type `IntSlice` based on this 2 types may be created using multiple return types in DSL-func:

```go
//go:generate typeinst
type _typeinst struct {
	IntSlice	func(T int) (somepkg.SliceA, somepkg.SliceF)
} 
```
`IntSlice` will contain both filtering and aggregation methods.

## __Limitations__

1. Imports in generic packages:
	- must have consistent import names across all files of the same generic package 
	- dot `.` import is not allowed
2. Type variables cannot be substituted by:
	- "anonymous" non-empty struct [solution: use named types or type alias]
	- "anonymous" non-empty interface [solution: the same]
3. Functions w/o receiver (except constructors) cannot be generic. [solution: use methods instead; ultimately generic types based on empty struct can be used as dummy receivers].
4. [Read generic package section](#generic-package)
5. Not all errors are checked during code generation, some of them will potentially result in uncompilable code: 
	- non generic code in generic package
	- merging unmergeable types
	- identifier name clashes


## __Implementation notes__

- AST rewriting is not used. Identifier substitution happens simultaneously with printing AST to file. For that purpose, the standard "go/printer" package was slightly modified: extra field `RenameFunc` was added to the `Config` struct.
- Typeinst has been used to generate a part of itself: [ðŸŒ€ gentypes.go](https://github.com/dlepex/typeinst/blob/master/gentypes.go)

## todo
